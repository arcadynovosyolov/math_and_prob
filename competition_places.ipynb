This means that we expect that 50% of the time participant 1 would win the competition, 30% of the time participant 2 would win the competition, and the rest 20% of the time the winner would be participant 3. What about places of other participants when the first one wins? I.e., can we calculate the probabilities of placements (1,2,3) and (1,3,2)?</p>\n",

    "<p>Just knowing probabilities of winning in not sufficient to solve the problem. However if we assume that probabilities of winning reflect <i>relative strength</i> of participants, the situation changes. By relative strength we mean the proportion 5:3:2 in which the participants win the competitions, and assume that the proportions kept untouched in a competition with a subset of participants. E.g., in a competition between participants 2 and 3 the probabilities of winning would form a proportion 30%:20% = 3:2, so in 60% of competitions which were won by number 1, the placing would be (1,2,3), and in the rest 40% of those competitions the placing would be (1,3,2).</p>\n",
