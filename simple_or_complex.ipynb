Each small cube may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 faces painted in red, denote $A_k$ events \"a random cube has exactly $k$ red faces\", $k=0, 1, 2, 3$. Next, denote $N(A_k)$ number of elements in $A_k$, clearly $N(A_0)=1,\\;N(A_1)=6,\\;N(A_2)=12,\\;N(A_3)=8$. Thus the probabilities of $A_k$ events are $$ P(A_0)=\\frac1{27},\\;P(A_1)=\\frac6{27},\\;P(A_2)=\\frac{12}{27},\\;P(A_3)=\\frac8{27}\\,. $$ Besides that we have for conditional probabilities of a red face on top, given the event $A_k$, equal to $$P(R|A_k)=\\frac{k}6,\\;k=0,1,2,3\\,.$$ The law of total probability now gives $$ P(R)=\\sum_{k=0}^3 P(R|A_k)P(A_k)=0\\cdot\\frac{1}{27}+\\frac{1}{6}\\frac{6}{27}+\\frac{2}{6}\\frac{12}{27}+\\frac{3}{6}\\frac{8}{27}=\\frac{1}{27}+\\frac{4}{27}+\\frac{4}{27}=\\frac{1}{3}\\,. $$"
